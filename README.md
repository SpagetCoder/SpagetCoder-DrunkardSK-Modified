# SpagetCoder-DrunkardSK-Modified

DrunkardSK addon for loot system modified by Xarra. DrunkardSK is an addon for World of Warcraft, it is used to distribute the loot.

Changes

    added posibiliy to select a winner manually
    added new voting option (Minor upgrade button)
    added alts support (alts cannot vote for main spec)
    voting is blocked if somone from the raid is not on the sk list
    modyfing players position on the list (delete, murder, move up or down, add new player) while the vote is active is no longer possible
    added button for reversing last vote
    added posibility to close the vote without choosing a winner (for Master looter only)
    alts will be added on the bottom of the list, normal players will be always above the alts, addon knows who is an alt, however it works only if your target is in the  inspection range (this is not my fault, blame blizzard not me :D)
    
    
    work in progress ??
